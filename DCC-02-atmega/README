This sketch is for the arduino portion of the DC-002 build.

It monitors an AC voltage reference and two current sensors
and reports their values continuously over a serial line to
be read by the ESP8266.

Calibration can be done by attaching UART to the arduino
and issuing a command in the form:

    SET 127.2 1.7 57.21 82.32 100

Where the parameters are:
  * ac_calibration
  * ac_phase_shift
  * l1_ct_calibration
  * l2_ct_calibration
  * crossings

A good way to do calibration is to put a known resistive load
on the sensors, connect the UART, and collect many measurements.
Put them into calibration.py to get the average values over
that time, the relative error, and the new calibration constants
to use.
